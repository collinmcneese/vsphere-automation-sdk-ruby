  # unit tests for create_temporary
  # Creates a temporary file.   Creates a new unique temporary file for the user to use as needed. The user is responsible for removing it when it is no longer needed.    The new file name will be created in a guest-specific format using prefix, a guest generated string and suffix in parentPath.    . Warning: This operation is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented.
  # @param vm Virtual Machine to perform the operation on. The parameter must be an identifier for the resource type: VirtualMachine.
  # @param interactive_session If set, the operation will interact with the logged-in desktop session in the guest. This requires that the logged-on user matches the user specified by the Credentials. This is currently only supported for USERNAME_PASSWORD. Warning: This attribute is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented.
  # @param type Types of guest credentials. Warning: This enumeration is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented.
  # @param prefix The prefix to be given to the new temporary file. XXX make this optional? Tools wants value, but we can pass an empty string.

If no user is specified for SAML_BEARER_TOKEN, a guest dependent mapping will decide what guest user account is applied.
