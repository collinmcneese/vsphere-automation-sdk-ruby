  # Applies a customization specification in spec on the virtual machine in vm. This operation only sets the specification settings for the virtual machine. The actual customization happens inside the guest when the virtual machine is powered on. If spec has unset values, then any pending customization settings for the virtual machine are cleared. If there is a pending customization for the virtual machine and spec has valid content, then the existing customization setting will be overwritten with the new settings.
