  # Returns information about the tags that are associated with virtual machines on this vCenter Server, where the tags need to match VM.FilterSpec.

  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :filter_tags Tag associations need to have one of the tag identifiers in this set to match the filter. Warning: This attribute is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented. If unset or empty, returns all tag associations. When clients pass a value of this structure as a parameter, the field must contain identifiers for the resource type: cis.tagging.Tag:VirtualMachine. When operations return a value of this structure as a result, the field will contain identifiers for the resource type: cis.tagging.Tag:VirtualMachine.
