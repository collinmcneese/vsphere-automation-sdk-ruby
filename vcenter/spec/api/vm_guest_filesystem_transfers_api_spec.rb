  # unit tests for get
  # Initiates an operation to transfer a file from the guest.   Obtains a URL to the file inside the guest to be transferred to the client.   If the power state of the Virtual Machine is changed when the file transfer is in progress, or the Virtual Machine is migrated, then the transfer operation is aborted.    In order to ensure a secure connection to the host when transferring a file using HTTPS, the X.509 certificate for the host must be used to authenticate the remote end of the connection. The certificate of the host that the virtual machine is running on can be retrieved using the following fields: XXX insert link to certificate in Host config XXX    . Warning: This operation is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented.
  # @param vm Virtual Machine to perform the operation on. The parameter must be an identifier for the resource type: VirtualMachine.
  # @param interactive_session If set, the operation will interact with the logged-in desktop session in the guest. This requires that the logged-on user matches the user specified by the Credentials. This is currently only supported for USERNAME_PASSWORD. Warning: This attribute is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented.
  # @param type Types of guest credentials. Warning: This enumeration is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented.
  # @param path The complete path to the file inside the guest that has to be transferred to the client. It cannot be a path to a directory or a symbolic link.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :user_name For SAML_BEARER_TOKEN, this is the guest user to be associated with the credentials. For USERNAME_PASSWORD this is the guest username. Warning: This attribute is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented. If no user is specified for SAML_BEARER_TOKEN, a guest dependent mapping will decide what guest user account is applied.
  # @option opts [String] :password password. Warning: This attribute is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented. This field is optional and it is only relevant when the value of Credentials.type is USERNAME_PASSWORD.

  # unit tests for put
  # Initiates an operation to transfer a file to the guest.   Obtains a URL to the file inside the guest to be transferred from the client. The user should send a HTTP PUT request specifying the file content in the body of the request. Multiple PUT request cannot be sent to the URL simultaneously. URL will be invalidated after a successful PUT request is sent. If the power state of the Virtual Machine is changed when the file transfer is in progress, or the Virtual Machine is migrated, then the transfer operation is aborted.

  # @param path The complete destination path in the guest to transfer the file from the client. It cannot be a path to a directory or a symbolic link.
  # @param file_size Size of the file to transfer to the guest in bytes. This specifies how many bytes are read; any extra are ignored. XXX need to call out what happens (if anythng) if the size is too big to fit. Appears to be no check.
