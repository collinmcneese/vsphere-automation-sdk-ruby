If unset or empty, all vCenter and Platform Services Controller nodes of type VCSA_EMBEDDED/PSC_EXTERNAL match the filter. When clients pass a value of this structure as a parameter, the field must contain identifiers for the resource type: vcenter.VCenter.name. When operations return a value of this structure as a result, the field will contain identifiers for the resource type: vcenter.VCenter.name.
