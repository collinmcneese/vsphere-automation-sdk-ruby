  # Returns tag associations that match the specified filter. Warning: This operation is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :iterate_size Size specifies the maximum number of results to return. Warning: This attribute is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented. If unset defaults to 5000.
  # @option opts [String] :iterate_marker Marker is an opaque data structure that allows the Host service to find where the previously returned page of tag associations has ended and where the new page should begin. Warning: This attribute is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented. If unset or empty, first page of tag associations will be returned. When clients pass a value of this structure as a parameter, the field must be an identifier for the resource type: vcenter.tag_associations.Marker. When operations return a value of this structure as a result, the field will be an identifier for the resource type: vcenter.tag_associations.Marker.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :filter_hosts Tag associations need to have one of the host identifiers in this set to match the filter. Warning: This attribute is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented. If unset or empty, tag associations with any host identifier match this filter. When clients pass a value of this structure as a parameter, the field must contain identifiers for the resource type: HostSystem. When operations return a value of this structure as a result, the field will contain identifiers for the resource type: HostSystem.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :filter_tags Tag associations need to have one of the tag identifiers in this set to match the filter. Warning: This attribute is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented.
