  # unit tests for remediate
  # Remediates the sync state between the linked domains by initiating a fresh sync for certificate providers. If an existing sync is in progress this cancels the sync. Usage beyond VMware Cloud on AWS is not supported. Warning: This operation is part of a new feature in development. It may be changed at any time and may not have all supported functionality implemented.

  # unit tests for reset
  # Resets the sync state between the linked domains by initiating a fresh sync for all providers. If an existing sync is in progress this cancels the sync. Usage beyond VMware Cloud on AWS is not supported. Warning: This operation is available as Technology Preview. These are early access APIs provided to test, automate and provide feedback on the feature. Since this can change based on feedback, VMware does not guarantee backwards compatibility and recommends against using them in production environments. Some Technology Preview APIs might only be applicable to specific environments.
