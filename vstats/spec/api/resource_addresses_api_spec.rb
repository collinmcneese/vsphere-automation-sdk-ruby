Some Technology Preview APIs might only be applicable to specific environments. When unset the result will not be filtered by resource types. When clients pass a value of this structure as a parameter, the field must contain identifiers for the resource type: vstats.model.RsrcType. When operations return a value of this structure as a result, the field will contain identifiers for the resource type: vstats.model.RsrcType.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :resources Resources to include in the query. Each resource is specified through a composite string that follows the following format.   type.&lt;resource type&gt;[.&lt;scheme&gt;]&#x3D;&lt;resource id&gt;    resource type specifies the type of resource for example VM, VCPU etc.    scheme is an optional element to disambiguate the resource as needed for example to differentiate managed object id from uuid.    resource id is the unique resource identifier value for example: vm-41    Example values include: type.VM&#x3D;vm-41, type.VCPU&#x3D;1, type.VM.moid&#x3D;vm-41 .

Some Technology Preview APIs might only be applicable to specific environments. When left unset the result will not be filtered for specific resources.
  # @option opts [String] :page The ResourceAddresses.FilterSpec.page field is used to retrieve paged data for large result sets. It is an opaque paging token obtained from a prior call to the ResourceAddresses.list API. Warning: This attribute is available as Technology Preview.
