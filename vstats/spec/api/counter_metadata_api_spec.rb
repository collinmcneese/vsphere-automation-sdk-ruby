  # unit tests for get_default
  # This operation returns the \&quot;default\&quot; CounterMetadata. A Counter has at least one related metadata object. Usually, stats providers (for example hosts) are in agreement about the default metadata. In this case the returned list has a single metadata object.   Sometimes, when providers are in \&quot;disagreement\&quot; about the default, then the returned list would include all the possible \&quot;defaults\&quot;. This potential ambiguity isn&#39;t a real issue because consumers of the vStats API rarely need to specify the \&quot;mid\&quot; of metadata. Therefore, this API is used primarily for informational purposes. . Warning: This operation is available as Technology Preview.
